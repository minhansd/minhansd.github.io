I am a senior [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) undergraduate student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/).  I am currently working on undergraduate research under Professor [Nikolay A. Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io) in the [Existential Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://existentialrobotics.org/index.html), relating to the application of particle flow filtering to POMDP algorithms, with some general topics being optimal control, reinforcement learning, decision theory, belief-space planning, and state estimation.  I also have research experience in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), applying it for radio-frequency (RF) signal data generation as part of an independent research project.

**Future Research Goals**

For future research, I am interested in exploring distributed, multi-agent, and swarm systems.  I also want to learn more about scalability, stability, and safety, as well as building on my understanding of topics like optimization, control theory, state estimation, reinforcement learning, and others from my current research. 

I am specifically intrigued by multi-agent robotic systems due to their capabilities to solve important problems in areas such as healthcare robotics and disaster response, which require vastly different toolsets that single-agent systems would struggle to provide.  There are also potential future efficiencies from focusing on the collaboration of simpler robots, as opposed to the development of more complex multifunctional robots, that I am curious about.  Additionally, I am interested in safety and stability, as they are core components of creating trustworthy and reliable autonomy. 

My current goals can be summarized in the following research questions:
- How can distributed, multi-agent, and swarm robotic systems be used to solve complex and important problems better than single-agent systems?
- How can we make sure such robotic systems are reliable, safe, and trustworthy?
- What tradeoffs exist between agent simplicity, agent count, and overall system performance in multi-agent systems?

However, despite these more specific interests, I am open to exploring any topic, problem, or opportunity across machine learning and robotics.  In general, I enjoy the creation of new ideas based on strong mathematical and theoretical foundations, especially within machine learning and robotics contexts. Any specific interests I have are mainly because I find the applications of the topic especially motivating. I also understand that my interests will evolve as I learn more, and I value all learning.
