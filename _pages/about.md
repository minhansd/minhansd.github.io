I am a senior [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) undergraduate student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/).  I am currently working on undergraduate research under Professor [Nikolay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io) in the [Existential Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://existentialrobotics.org/index.html), relating to particle flow particle filtering, optimal control, and POMDPs.

For future research, I am interested in exploring the development of scalable and trustworthy distributed, multi-agent, or swarm autonomy, including theoretical guarantees on coordination accuracy and stability, along with robustness to uncertainty, in safety-critical and precision-critical environments.
