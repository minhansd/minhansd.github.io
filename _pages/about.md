I am currently a senior Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) focusing on the machine learning and controls depth within UCSD's [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://ece.ucsd.edu/). I am interested in exploring the development of scalable and trustworthy distributed, multi-agent, or swarm autonomy, including theoretical guarantees on coordination accuracy and stability, along with robustness to uncertainty, in safety-critical and precision-critical environments.
