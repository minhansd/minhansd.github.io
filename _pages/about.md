I am a senior [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) undergraduate student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/).  I am currently working on undergraduate research under Professor [Nikolay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io) in the [Existential Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://existentialrobotics.org/index.html), relating to particle flow particle filtering, optimal control, and POMDPs.  

For future research, I am interested in exploring distributed, multi-agent, and swarm systems.  I also want to learn more about robot scalability, stability, trustworthiness, and safety, as well as building on my understanding of topics like optimization, control theory, state estimation, reinforcement learning, and others from my current research. I am specifically intrigued by multi-agent robotic systems due to their capabilities to solve important problems in areas such as healthcare robotics and disaster response, which require vastly different toolsets that single-agent systems would struggle to provide.  There are also potential future efficiencies from focusing on the collaboration of simpler robots, as opposed to the development of more complex multifunctional robots, that I am curious about.  However, despite these more specific interests, I am open to exploring any topic, problem, or opportunity across machine learning and robotics.  In general, I enjoy the creation of new ideas based on strong mathematical and theoretical foundations, especially within machine learning and robotics contexts, and any specific interests I have are mainly because I find the applications of the topic especially motivating.
