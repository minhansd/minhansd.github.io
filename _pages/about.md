I am a senior [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) undergraduate student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/).  I am currently working on undergraduate research under Professor [Nikolay A. Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io) in the [Existential Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://existentialrobotics.org/index.html), relating to the application of particle flow filtering to POMDP algorithms, with some general topics being optimal control, reinforcement learning, decision theory, belief-space planning, and state estimation.  I also have research experience in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), applying it for radio-frequency (RF) signal data generation as part of an independent research project.

**Future Research Goals**

In the future, I hope to make reliable, trustworthy, and efficient robots that can help better society, especially by solving challenging and complex problems beyond human ability.  I find that this overarching goal has developed into interests in a few specific research areas.

I am very interested in planning and control under uncertainty, as accounting for uncertainty is essential for robots to perform well in real-world settings. In the same vein, I am drawn to system stability and robot safety–some of the cornerstone topics in robot reliability and trustworthiness.

Also, in line with my long-term goals, I have become intrigued by distributed, multi-agent, and swarm robotic systems due to their capabilities to solve important problems in areas such as healthcare robotics and disaster response, which can require vastly different toolsets that single-agent systems would struggle to provide.  I especially want to explore some of the more theoretical aspects of multi-agent systems, such as coordination algorithms, as well as exploring the intricacies of decentralized systems.

While I am very motivated by the practical implications of the topics I have just listed, I am equally fascinated by their general mathematical and theoretical foundations in areas like optimization, stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and control theory, and I hope to continue building on my knowledge of these areas. 

However, despite these more specific interests, I am open to exploring any topic, problem, or opportunity across machine learning and robotics. My interests above come from my current experiences and knowledge in the robotics and machine learning field, and they will evolve as I learn more across different parts of the field.

In general, I enjoy the creation of new ideas based on strong mathematical and theoretical foundations, especially within machine learning and robotics contexts.
