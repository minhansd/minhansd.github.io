excerpt: "TensorFlow classification, supervised/unsupervised learning, Fashion-MNIST"
---

- Experimented with TensorFlow to find signal classification algorithms
  - Trained neural networks on the Fashion MNIST dataset  
    - Grayscale pixel values of images  
    - Images are labeled with correct answers (supervised learning)
- Can quantify signals using values such as amplitude, period, waveform, etc.
  - Labeled signals with correct names → model learns patterns
- Studied Coursera Machine Learning Course (TensorFlow)
  - Supervised and unsupervised learning
  - Linear and logistic regression, clustering
  - Neural networks and deep learning
