- Experimented with TensorFlow to find signal classification algorithms
    - Trained neural networks on the Fashion MNIST dataset  
        - Grayscale pixel values of images  
        - Images are labeled with correct answers (supervised learning)
- Can quantify signals using values such as amplitude, period, waveform, etc.
    - Labeled signals with correct names → model learns patterns
- Studied Coursera Machine Learning course (TensorFlow)
    - Supervised and unsupervised learning
    - Linear and logistic regression, clustering
    - Neural networks and deep learning
