  <ul>
    <li>
      Created a bare-metal C program on the Xilinx Zynq using Vivado and Vitis to create a GUI on an LCD screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      Customized driver code for the screen on an STMicroelectronics Nucleo-144 F767ZI board (“white board”),
      using oscilloscopes to analyze and recreate the sent signals with the Zybo board.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adapted the screen to a Xilinx-based board, allowing the company to integrate it into Vivado and into the final radio system.
