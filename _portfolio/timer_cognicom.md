  <ul>
    <li>
      Timer circuit programmed on a low-power FPGA using Verilog
      <ul>
        <li>Made to keep track of time when radio is not connected to external timing source</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Used ModelSim and Aldec Active-HDL to simulate Verilog program and timing</li>
    <li>
      Used serial communication protocols to transmit and receive information for radio's main FPGA
    </li>
